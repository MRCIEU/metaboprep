\arguments{
\item{metaboprep}{an object of class Metabolites}

\item{source_layer}{character, the data layer to summarise}

\item{sample_missingness}{numeric 0-1, percentage of data missingness which should prompt exclusion of a sample}

\item{feature_missingness}{numeric 0-1, percentage of data missingness which should prompt exclusion of a feature}

\item{total_peak_area_sd}{numeric, number of TPA SD after which a sample would be excluded}

\item{outlier_udist}{the unit distance in SD or IQR from the mean or median estimate, respectively outliers are identified at. Default value is 5.}

\item{outlier_treatment}{character, how to handle outlier data values - options 'leave_be', 'turn_NA', or 'winsorize'}

\item{winsorize_quantile}{numeric, quantile to winsorize to, only relevant if 'outlier_treatment'='winsorize'}

\item{tree_cut_height}{numeric, the threshold for feature independence in hierarchical clustering. Default is 0.5.}

\item{pc_outlier_sd}{numeric, number of PCA SD after which a sample would be excluded}

\item{derived_col}{character, the column name of a logical column in the features data indicating derived features such as ratios}

\item{xenobiotic_col}{character, the column name of a logical column in the features data indicating xenobiotics features such as medication levels}

\item{sample_ids}{character, vector of sample ids to work with}

\item{feature_ids}{character, vector of feature ids to work with}
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper function that performs the key quality controls steps on a metabolomics data set.
Key principles:
 1. keep the source underlying data as it is
 2. copy the source data to a new data layer called qcing for processing
 3. build an exclusion list, accumulating codes for exclusion reasons
 4. make any adjustments needed in the destination copy of the data, flag these in the exclusion list
 5. copy the final result to a data layer called post_qc
 6. return the Metabolites object with the newly populated data layers
